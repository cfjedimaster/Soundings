========================================= CURRENT UPDATES =========================================
Last Update: July 16, 2014 (Version 4.5.3)
/cfcs/settings.xml.cfm - version and attachmentdir setting. The attachment dir setting is for the
new attachment question type. You *must* set this to an existing directory (preferably out of web
root) even if you don't plan on using the new question type.

To finish support for the new question type, insert a new row into questiontypes by simply copying and
pasting the script from the install folder. Not the entire script of course, just the insert line.

Other files have changed too - see the last github update for more info.

Last Update: November 21, 2011 (Version 4.1)

A major update to branching has been added. You can now do multiple
'logic' thingies based on question responses. Unfortunately, any older
survey that used this logic will not be supported. Simply go to your survey
and update it with your logic.

Note - nextquestion and nextquestionvalue have been removed from the questions
table and questionbranches has been added as a table.

As for the files, I'd recommend copying everything ever.

Last Update: December 19, 2008 (Version 3)
Final release of 3. Please note the Access database has not been updated. Looking for a volunteer.

Last Update: December 12, 2008 (Version 3)

Please copy all files. I've changed far too many to list them all. I'll describe new features below.

The following database changes must be made - see individual install scripts for precise column types.

surveys:
	add useridfk - varchar/35
	add templateidfk - varchar/35
	add allowembed - tinyint/1
	add showinpubliclist - tinyint/1
	
templates table - new - copy from db script

users:
	add id - varchar/35
	add isAdmin - tinyint/1
	
Now go into the migrate3 folder. Open Application.cfm and remove <cfabort>. Run userid.cfm. This gives a UUID to every user. 
Then run assignsurveys.cfm. You ONLY have to run this if you have surveys. It assigns all surveys to the first user in the 
system. You can edit the userid to assign them all to some other user.

Note - you must edit the users table and set yourself to isAdmin=1.

NEW FEATURES:

Users can be set to be an admin, or just a normal users. The migration script sets everyone to admins. A user that is
not an admin does not have the ability to edit question types or other users. Think of these as survey creators only.
When they view surveys, they will only see their own content. Ditto for reporting. Basically, they have their own system
now.

Surveys have multiple new options.

Show in Public List: This refers to the simple list of surveys on the Soundings public page. Turning this off doesn't protect surveys,
it just removes it from the list. Use this is you want to hand out the URL for a survey to people but not have it shown to the world
at large.

Embed: If turned on, you will be given embed code (iframe) that allows you to place the survey on another site.

Templates: You can now pick a template for a survey. If selected, the header and footer from the template is used instead of the default
Soundings UI.

Reporting: You can now filter reports by dates. I also now show a response rate for optional questions.

/stylesheets/style.css - a style for required questions

 /cfcs/survey.cfc - support longer email addresses

10/8/05
Many files changed, so I recommend copying all of them over.
Added support for Matrix style questions. This requires 1-2 database changes.
The first change you must make. Edit the results table and add a itemidfk column. Type should be nvarchar (or equivalent) with size=35. Null ok.
The second change is to add support for Matrix style questions. You can either copy the insert from the db script, or use the Soundings admin
to add it yourself. Name should be Matrix, and handler root should be matrix.
